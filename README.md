# Flyway JUnit 5 Extensions

This extensions allows you to clean / migrate your database using Flyway during testing.

## How to use it?

Add the following dependency to your project:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.radcortez.flyway</groupId>
  <artifactId>flyway-junit5-extensions</artifactId>
  <version>1.0</version>
  <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
```

---
**NOTE**: 

This project depends on:
- Flyway 6.4.2
- JUnit Jupiter 5.6.2

---

Add the `@FlywayTest` annotation to your test class or method. By default, Flyway will perform the `migrate` action 
before each test execution and the `clean` action after the test. This can be disabled by turning `clean = false` in 
the `@FlywayTest` annotation.  

The only required information in the `@FlywayTest` annotation is the database information that you can supply using 
the inner `@Datasource` annotation. In the `@Datasource` annotation you can specify the `url`, `user` and `password` 
to connect to a running database:

```java
@FlywayTest(datasource = @Datasource(url = "jdbc:h2:mem:test"))
class JUnit5Test {

}
```

Or you can implement a `DatasourceProvider` and return a `DatasourceInfo` with the database connection details:

```java 
@FlywayTest(datasource = @Datasource(H2DatasourceProvider.class))
class JUnit5Test {

}

static class H2DatasourceProvider implements DatasourceProvider {
    @Override
    public DatasourceInfo getDatasourceInfo(final ExtensionContext extensionContext) {
        return DatasourceInfo.config("jdbc:h2:mem:test;MODE=PostgreSQL;DB_CLOSE_DELAY=-1");
    }
}
```

The `DatasourceProvider` will always take priority over `url`, `user` and `password` in the `@Datasource` annotation.

The `@FlywayTest` annotation can also be placed in a method. 

```java 
@FlywayTest(locations = "db/additionalLocation")
void additionalLocations() throws Exception {

}
```

When both the class and the method are annotated, the annotations metadata is merged with the method annotation taking 
priority over the class annotaton.

### Conventions

By default, the extension uses the default path to load migration scripts from Flyway, set in `resources/db/migration`.

If you want to add specific database migrations to a particular test, you can place the migration files in `db/` 
plus the fully qualified name of the test as a path. For instance `db/com/radcortez/flyway/test/junit/H2LocationTest`.

Additional migration locations can be defined using the `additionalLocations` metadata in the `@FlywayTest` annotation. 
This will not override the default locations, but just add an additional location for the migration files.

### Meta Annotations

You can also place the `@FlywayTest` annotation in a meta annotation and then use it in the test class.

```java
@Target(ElementType.TYPE)
@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
@FlywayTest(datasource = @Datasource(url = "jdbc:h2:mem:test"))
@interface H2 {

}

@H2
class H2MetaAnnotationTest {
    
}
```

The `@H2` annotation is already available in the extension, but you need to remember to add the H2 dependency to your 
project to be able to use an H2 database:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.h2database</groupId>
  <artifactId>h2</artifactId>
  <version>1.4.199</version>
  <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
```
